COVID19-DATA-EXPLORATION By Priscilla Latinwo


INTRODUCTION

In this Data Exploration Analysis Project, SQL was used to explore trends and insights in COVID19 Data within the last few years (2020 - 2021) of the pandemic.


DATA SOURCE

The dataset was professionally obtained from ourworldindata.org and gotten from the link https://ourworldindata.org/covid-cases


METHODOLOGY

The initial dataset was cleaned in excel and transformed into two seperate excel workbooks for both Covid cases and Covid vaccinations. 
These workbooks were joined using SQL to extract the needed data for the exploration. Exploratory analysis was then done using SQL. transformed dataset was moved to
tableau for insightful visualization.


THE QUESTIONS THAT NEEDED TO BE ANSWERED

1. What was the total deaths cases during this period?
2 What continents had the highest deaths rates?
3. What countries had the highest infection rates?
4. What was the average cases in each country over time


SUMMARY OF THE KEY FINDINGS

For this exploratory analysis, the main goal was to analyse covid cases and deaths in relationship to location and population.
From the analysis, it was discovered that about 2% of the total covid cases globally lead to deaths. Similarly, a higher percentage of these deaths were from North and South 
America. Investigating further, it was discovered that there was a spike in the average Covid cases in the United states, compared to other countries, which was about 10% of 
the total population. This also kept the United states as the country with the highest deaths during this period.
